# Chapter 4 - The Radial Velocity Method

## 4.1 The Stellar Wobble

A planet does not orbit a stationary star.

Instead, both the planet and the star orbit their common center of mass. Because the star is far more massive, its motion is small—but not zero. The star executes a subtle reflex motion, moving alternately toward and away from us as the planet orbits.

This motion shifts the star’s spectral lines via the Doppler effect.

When the star moves toward us, its light is blueshifted.  
When it moves away, its light is redshifted.

By measuring these shifts with exquisite precision, we detect planets.

## 4.2 The Doppler Effect

The fractional wavelength shift due to motion along the line of sight is

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v_r}{c},
\]

where:

- \( v_r \) is the radial velocity of the star  
- \( c \) is the speed of light  

For a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting a Sun-like star at 1 AU, the stellar velocity amplitude is about 12 m/s.

For an Earth analog, the signal is only about 9 cm/s.

Detecting such small velocities requires spectrographs capable of measuring wavelength shifts of less than one part in a billion.

---

## 4.3 The Radial Velocity Curve

The star’s velocity varies periodically. For a single planet on a circular orbit, the radial velocity follows a sinusoidal pattern:

\[
v_r(t) = K \sin \left( \frac{2\pi t}{P} + \phi \right),
\]

where:

- \( K \) is the velocity semi-amplitude  
- \( P \) is the orbital period  
- \( \phi \) is the phase  

For eccentric orbits, the curve becomes asymmetric, encoding information about orbital shape and orientation.

From radial velocity data, we measure:

- Orbital period \( P \)
- Velocity semi-amplitude \( K \)
- Orbital eccentricity \( e \)
- Argument of periastron \( \omega \)

---

## 4.4 From Velocity to Mass

The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by

\[
K = \left( \frac{2\pi G}{P} \right)^{1/3}
\frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_\star + M_p)^{2/3}}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}},
\]

where:

- \( M_p \) is the planetary mass  
- \( M_\star \) is the stellar mass  
- \( i \) is the orbital inclination  

Because the inclination \( i \) is generally unknown, radial velocities yield only the **minimum mass**, \( M_p \sin i \).

If the planet also transits, then \( i \) is close to 90°, and the true mass can be determined. Combining radial velocity with transit measurements provides both mass and radius—leading to bulk density.

Density is the gateway to composition.

## 4.5 Precision and Instrumentation

Modern radial velocity spectrographs achieve precision of 1 m/s or better.

This is accomplished through:

- High spectral resolution  
- Extreme instrumental stability  
- Temperature and pressure control  
- Precise wavelength calibration (e.g., iodine cells, laser frequency combs)  

The challenge is not merely detecting Doppler shifts, but distinguishing them from stellar variability.

Stars are not static surfaces. They pulsate, rotate, harbor spots, and exhibit convective motions. These phenomena can produce apparent velocity shifts comparable to planetary signals.

Extracting planetary signals requires modeling stellar noise with care.

---

## 4.6 Stellar Activity and False Signals

Stellar activity can mimic planetary radial velocity signals.

Rotating starspots distort spectral line profiles. As the star rotates, the asymmetry shifts, producing apparent Doppler variations.

Granulation and magnetic cycles introduce additional velocity variability.

To disentangle planets from stellar activity, astronomers use:

- Activity indicators (e.g., Ca II H & K lines)  
- Line bisector analysis  
- Simultaneous photometry  
- Multi-wavelength observations  

Understanding the host star is inseparable from detecting its planets.

---

## 4.7 Multiple-Planet Systems

Radial velocity data often reveal more than one periodic signal.

Multi-planet systems produce superpositions of sinusoidal curves. Long-term monitoring allows detection of planets with periods spanning years or decades.

Some systems exhibit resonances, dynamical interactions, and measurable gravitational perturbations.

Radial velocities have uncovered:

- Compact multi-planet systems  
- Long-period gas giants  
- Highly eccentric planets  
- Planets orbiting evolved stars  

The method is sensitive to a wide range of orbital separations, particularly those inaccessible to transit surveys.

---

## 4.8 The First Exoplanet Around a Sun-like Star

In 1995, astronomers detected a periodic radial velocity signal from the star 51 Pegasi.

The planet, 51 Pegasi b, was a gas giant orbiting extremely close to its star—a configuration previously thought unlikely.

The discovery reshaped theories of planetary formation and migration.

It demonstrated that precise radial velocity measurements could reveal entirely new classes of planets.

---

## 4.9 Long-Period and Massive Planets

Radial velocity surveys are particularly well-suited to detecting:

- Massive planets  
- Planets at moderate orbital distances  
- Non-transiting planets  

Unlike the transit method, radial velocity does not require special geometric alignment.

However, it is biased toward higher-mass planets and those orbiting lower-mass stars.

Long-period planets require patience. Some detections span decades of data collection.

---

## 4.10 The Earth Analog Challenge

Detecting an Earth-mass planet in a 1-year orbit around a Sun-like star requires measuring velocity shifts of about 9 cm/s.

This is comparable to:

- The walking speed of a human  
- The convective motions on the stellar surface  
- Instrumental systematics  

Achieving this precision remains one of the grand challenges of exoplanet detection.

Future instruments aim to reach this level, but stellar noise may ultimately limit detectability.

---

## 4.11 Complementarity with Transits

Radial velocity and transit methods are complementary.

Transits provide:

- Planetary radius  
- Orbital inclination  
- Atmospheric access  

Radial velocities provide:

- Planetary mass  
- Orbital eccentricity  
- Detection of non-transiting companions  

Together, they yield planetary density:

\[
\rho_p = \frac{M_p}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_p^3}.
\]

Density distinguishes rocky planets from gas-rich worlds.

Without radial velocities, many transiting planets would remain dimensionless shadows.

---

## 4.12 Beyond Detection

Radial velocity measurements also reveal:

- Planet–planet interactions  
- Secular evolution  
- Long-term orbital stability  
- Spin–orbit alignment (via the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect during transit)  

The Rossiter–McLaughlin effect arises because a transiting planet blocks part of a rotating stellar disk, distorting spectral lines and revealing the projected angle between stellar spin and planetary orbit.

Such measurements probe planetary migration histories.

## 4.13 A Dynamic Universe

The radial velocity method teaches us that planetary systems are dynamic.

Stars move in response to unseen companions.  
Orbits can be circular or eccentric.  
Planets may migrate inward or remain distant.  

From tiny shifts in spectral lines, we infer gravitational architectures across light-years.

The method is fundamentally dynamical. It relies on Newton’s laws and the Doppler effect.

The physics is centuries old.  
The measurements are modern.  

And the result is a census of planetary masses in the galaxy.
