# Chapter 5 — Other Worlds: Planets Beyond the Sun

For most of human history, we did not know.

We wondered.

Are there other worlds?  
Do other stars have planets?  
Is Earth rare — or common?

Today, we know the answer.

The universe is filled with planets.

## The First Discovery

In 1995, astronomers confirmed the first planet orbiting a Sun-like star.

It was not what anyone expected.

It was enormous.  
It orbited extremely close to its star.  
It was hotter than Mercury.

The universe immediately surprised us.

Since then, thousands of planets have been discovered.

And that number keeps growing.

## What Is an Exoplanet?

An **exoplanet** is simply a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun.

Some are:
- Larger than Jupiter  
- Smaller than Earth  
- Made of gas  
- Made of rock  
- Possibly covered in oceans  
- Possibly shrouded in thick clouds  

There is more variety than our Solar System alone ever suggested.

## How Do We Find Them?

Planets are incredibly hard to see directly.

Stars are bright.  
Planets are faint.

So instead of seeing the planet, we watch the star.

### 1. The Transit Method

Sometimes a planet passes in front of its star.

When it does, it blocks a tiny fraction of the starlight.

The star appears to dim — just slightly.

By measuring this tiny dip in brightness, we can detect a planet.

It is like noticing a small insect flying across a distant streetlamp.

### 2. The Wobble Method

Planets pull on their stars.

As a planet orbits, the star moves slightly too.

This causes the star to wobble.

By measuring this tiny motion, astronomers can infer the presence of a planet.

Even though the planet remains unseen, its gravity gives it away.

## What Have We Found?

The discoveries have changed how we think about the universe.

There are:

- “Hot Jupiters” — giant planets skimming the surfaces of their stars  
- “Super-Earths” — rocky worlds larger than our planet  
- Compact planetary systems with many worlds packed close together  
- Planets orbiting red dwarf stars  
- Planets in binary star systems  

Some planetary systems look nothing like ours.

Nature is more creative than we imagined.

---

## Are Any of Them Like Earth?

Some planets orbit in what we call the **habitable zone** — the region around a star where temperatures might allow liquid water.

Liquid water is important because all known life on Earth depends on it.

But being in the habitable zone does not guarantee life.

A planet’s atmosphere, composition, and history matter too.

The search for Earth-like worlds is still ongoing.

---

## Can We Study Their Atmospheres?

Yes.

When a planet passes in front of its star, a tiny amount of starlight filters through the planet’s atmosphere.

That light carries fingerprints.

From those fingerprints, astronomers can detect:

- Water vapor  
- Carbon dioxide  
- Methane  
- Clouds  

We are beginning to study the chemistry of distant worlds.

We are no longer just counting planets.

We are analyzing them.

## A Universe of Planets

There are more planets in our galaxy than stars.

That means billions of planetary systems.

Billions of possible skies.

Somewhere in the Milky Way, a planet may orbit a quiet star, with oceans, clouds, and perhaps life.

And perhaps, on that planet, someone is asking:

Are there other worlds?

---

## A Quiet Perspective

For most of history, Earth was the only known planet with life.

Now we know that planets are common.

The discovery of exoplanets has changed not just astronomy — but philosophy.

We are no longer imagining other worlds.

We are finding them.

And the search has just begun.
