For most of human history, the night sky looked permanent and unchanging. The stars were distant lights, the planets wandering points, and our Solar System seemed complete and singular. We knew the Sun, its eight planets, their moons, the asteroid belt, distant comets — and nothing beyond.

The idea that other stars might host their own planets was ancient. Philosophers imagined it. Poets celebrated it. Scientists debated it. But for centuries, it remained speculation — elegant, but untested.

That changed in the 1990s.

With advances in precision spectroscopy and photometry, astronomers finally detected the first planets orbiting other stars. The discovery was not subtle. The first confirmed detections revealed worlds unlike anything in our Solar System: giant planets orbiting scorchingly close to their stars. “Hot Jupiters” were not predicted by classical Solar System theory — yet there they were.

Soon after, astronomers achieved something even more remarkable: the direct imaging of exoplanets. Systems such as HR 8799 revealed multiple massive planets glowing in infrared light, physically separated from their host star in telescope images. These observations required sophisticated techniques to block out the overwhelming glare of the star, but they demonstrated that planets around other stars could, in some cases, be seen directly.

However, it is important to emphasize that **most exoplanets are not directly observed**. They are detected indirectly — through the tiny wobble they induce on their star, the minute dip in starlight when they transit, or other subtle gravitational and photometric effects. Direct imaging remains challenging and is currently limited primarily to young, massive planets orbiting far from their stars.

The Universe, it turned out, was far more imaginative than we had assumed.

An **exoplanet** (or *extrasolar planet*) is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. Today, thousands are confirmed, and thousands more await verification. These worlds range from lava-covered giants hugging their stars to icy super-Earths, from planets orbiting pulsars to compact multi-planet systems tightly packed around red dwarfs.

Some are larger than Jupiter.  
Some are smaller than Earth.  
Some may have oceans.  
Some may have clouds made of glass.

Exoplanet science has transformed astronomy. We are no longer studying a single planetary system — we are studying planetary systems as a population. We now ask statistical questions:

- How common are Earth-sized planets?
- How do planets form and migrate?
- What determines whether a planet keeps an atmosphere?
- Are habitable worlds rare — or inevitable?

This field is young. Most of what we know has been learned within a single human generation. And yet it has already reshaped our understanding of planet formation, stellar physics, atmospheric chemistry, and even the search for life.

We began with one example.

Now we are surrounded by worlds.

## 1.2 The First Discoveries

The first confirmed exoplanets were discovered in 1992—not around a Sun-like star, but around a pulsar. These planets orbited the neutron star PSR B1257+12, showing that planets can form—or survive—even in extreme environments.

In 1995, the first exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star was discovered: **51 Pegasi b**. This planet was a "hot Jupiter"—a gas giant orbiting extremely close to its host star. Its discovery challenged long-standing theories of planetary formation and sparked a revolution in astronomy.

Since then, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered using a variety of detection methods, revealing a universe filled with planetary diversity.

## 1.3 How Do We Detect Exoplanets?

Because exoplanets are faint and lie extremely close to bright stars, we rarely see them directly. Instead, we detect them indirectly through their effects on their host stars.

### 1.3.1 The Transit Method

When a planet passes in front of its star, it blocks a small fraction of starlight. This produces a periodic dip in brightness known as a **transit**.

From transits, astronomers can measure:
- The planet’s radius  
- Its orbital period  
- Its distance from the star (via Kepler’s Third Law)  

Space telescopes like *Kepler* and *TESS* have discovered thousands of planets using this technique.

### 1.3.2 The Radial Velocity Method

A planet’s gravity pulls on its star, causing the star to wobble slightly. This motion shifts the star’s spectral lines due to the Doppler effect.

From radial velocity measurements, astronomers can determine:
- The planet’s minimum mass  
- Its orbital period  
- Orbital eccentricity  

Together, transit and radial velocity measurements allow us to estimate a planet’s **density**, which provides clues about its composition.

## 1.4 A Zoo of Worlds

Exoplanets come in many varieties:

- **Hot Jupiters** — Gas giants orbiting extremely close to their stars  
- **Warm Neptunes** — Intermediate-mass planets with thick atmospheres  
- **Super-Earths** — Rocky planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune  
- **Mini-Neptunes** — Low-density planets with significant gaseous envelopes  
- **Temperate terrestrial planets** — Potentially rocky worlds in the habitable zone  

One of the most surprising discoveries is that the most common types of planets in the galaxy—super-Earths and mini-Neptunes—do not exist in our Solar System.

Our planetary system is not typical.

## 1.5 Why Exoplanets Matter

Studying exoplanets helps us answer some of the most profound scientific questions:

- How do planetary systems form and evolve?
- How common are Earth-like planets?
- What determines planetary atmospheres?
- Are we alone in the universe?

Exoplanet research connects astrophysics, planetary science, atmospheric chemistry, and even biology. It represents one of the most interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving fields in modern science.

## 1.6 The Era of Atmospheric Characterization

We are no longer limited to detecting planets—we can now probe their atmospheres.

During transits, some starlight passes through a planet’s atmosphere. Different molecules absorb light at specific wavelengths, leaving fingerprints in the observed spectrum. This technique, known as **transmission spectroscopy**, allows astronomers to detect:

- Water vapor  
- Methane  
- Carbon dioxide  
- Clouds and hazes  
- Temperature structures  

With telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we are entering an era where detailed atmospheric studies are becoming routine.

## 1.7 A Population Perspective

The true power of exoplanet science lies not in studying one planet, but many.

By analyzing large samples, astronomers can identify trends:
- How planet size varies with stellar mass  
- How metallicity influences giant planet occurrence  
- How stellar activity affects atmospheric measurements  
- How orbital architectures differ across systems  

Exoplanet science has evolved from individual discoveries to statistical population studies.

## 1.8 Looking Ahead

The next decades will bring:
- More precise mass and radius measurements  
- High-resolution atmospheric spectroscopy  
- Direct imaging of Earth-like planets  
- Biosignature searches  

We began with a philosophical question: *Are there other worlds?*

Now we ask:  
*What are those worlds like?*  
*How do they form?*  
*Could they host life?*

This book explores those questions.

The universe is not empty.

It is filled with planets.
