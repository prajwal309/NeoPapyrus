# Chapter 2 — Momentum: The Language of Motion

Momentum is one of the most powerful ideas in physics.  
It connects force to motion, explains collisions, governs planetary orbits, and determines how rockets escape Earth.

If gravity tells us *why* objects attract, momentum tells us *how motion is exchanged*.

## 2.1 Linear Momentum

The linear momentum **p** of a particle of mass *m* moving with velocity **v** is defined as

$$
\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}.
$$

Momentum is a **vector quantity**. Its direction is the same as the velocity.

### Why Momentum Matters

Velocity alone does not measure “impact.”  
A truck and a bicycle moving at the same speed have very different momenta because their masses differ.

Momentum captures both:
- How fast something moves
- How much matter is moving

---

## 2.2 Newton’s Second Law in Momentum Form

Newton’s Second Law is more fundamentally written as:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}.
$$

If mass is constant:

$$
\mathbf{F} = m\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = m\mathbf{a}.
$$

But the momentum form is more general. It works even when mass changes — such as in rockets.

---

## 2.3 Impulse

If a force acts over a time interval, it produces an **impulse**:

$$
\mathbf{J} = \int \mathbf{F}\,dt.
$$

Impulse equals the change in momentum:

$$
\mathbf{J} = \Delta \mathbf{p}.
$$

This explains why airbags reduce injury:
- They increase the time of impact
- The same change in momentum occurs
- The force is reduced

---

## 2.4 Conservation of Momentum

If no external force acts on a system:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{p}_{\text{total}}}{dt} = 0.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathbf{p}_{\text{total}} = \text{constant}.
$$

Momentum is conserved in all isolated systems.

---

## 2.5 Collisions

Consider two objects with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\).

Before collision:

$$
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2
$$

After collision:

$$
m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2'
$$

Conservation of momentum gives:

$$
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2'.
$$

### Elastic Collisions

Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.

### Inelastic Collisions

Momentum is conserved.  
Kinetic energy is not.

---

## 2.6 Center of Mass

The center of mass of a system is:

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\text{CM}} = \frac{1}{M}\sum m_i \mathbf{r}_i.
$$

Total momentum of a system:

$$
\mathbf{P} = M\mathbf{V}_{\text{CM}}.
$$

This means:
The entire system behaves as if all mass were concentrated at the center of mass.

---

## 2.7 Rocket Propulsion

A rocket expels mass backward.

Using conservation of momentum:

$$
M dv = - v_e dM.
$$

Integrating:

$$
v = v_e \ln \left(\frac{M_0}{M}\right).
$$

This is the **Tsiolkovsky rocket equation**.

Escape from Earth requires enormous momentum change — not just high velocity.

---

## 2.8 Angular Momentum

For a particle:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}.
$$

For circular motion:

$$
L = mvr.
$$

Angular momentum changes according to torque:

$$
\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}.
$$

---

## 2.9 Conservation of Angular Momentum

If no external torque acts:

$$
\mathbf{L} = \text{constant}.
$$

This explains:
- Why planets sweep equal areas (Kepler’s Second Law)
- Why figure skaters spin faster when pulling arms inward
- Why collapsing stars spin rapidly

---

## 2.10 Angular Momentum in Astronomy

For a planet orbiting a star:

$$
L = m r^2 \dot{\theta}.
$$

Because angular momentum is conserved:

$$
r^2 \dot{\theta} = \text{constant}.
$$

Planets move faster when closer to the star.

This governs:
- Orbital motion
- Accretion disks
- Galaxy formation
- Black hole spin

---

## 2.11 Momentum in Two-Body Systems

For two gravitating masses:

Total momentum is conserved:

$$
m_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{v}_2 = 0.
$$

Both bodies orbit their common center of mass.

This is how we detect exoplanets:
- The star moves slightly
- We measure its Doppler shift
- That shift reveals planetary momentum

---

## 2.12 Momentum in Modern Physics

In relativity:

$$
\mathbf{p} = \gamma m\mathbf{v},
$$

where

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
$$

Momentum grows rapidly as velocity approaches the speed of light.

In quantum mechanics:

$$
\mathbf{p} = -i\hbar \nabla.
$$

Momentum becomes an operator.

# Summary

Momentum is conserved in isolated systems.  
Angular momentum is conserved when no torque acts.  
These principles govern:

- Collisions
- Rocket propulsion
- Planetary orbits
- Stellar collapse
- Galaxy dynamics

Momentum is not merely a quantity — it is the symmetry of motion.
