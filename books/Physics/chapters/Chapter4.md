# Chapter 4 — Electromagnetism: Light, Fields, and the Structure of the Cosmos

## 4.1 Why Electromagnetism?

If gravity shapes the architecture of the universe, electromagnetism illuminates it.

Nearly everything we observe in astronomy—starlight, radio waves, X-rays from black holes, polarization of dust, synchrotron emission from jets—arises from electromagnetic processes.

Electromagnetism governs:

- The emission of radiation  
- Atomic and molecular spectra  
- Plasma dynamics  
- Magnetic fields in stars and galaxies  
- Accretion disks and relativistic jets  

Understanding electromagnetism is essential to understanding how we observe and interpret the universe.

# Part I — Foundations of Electromagnetic Fields

## 4.2 Electric Charge and Coulomb’s Law

The electric force between two point charges is:

\[
F = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}
\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}.
\]

This resembles gravity:

- Both are inverse-square laws  
- Both are central forces  

But unlike gravity:

- Electric charge can be positive or negative  
- Forces can attract or repel  
- The electromagnetic force is vastly stronger  

In astrophysical plasmas, charge separation rarely persists over large scales because opposite charges neutralize quickly. However, electric fields play important roles in local acceleration processes.

---

## 4.3 The Electric Field

Instead of thinking in terms of forces between charges, we define a field:

\[
\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q}.
\]

For a point charge:

\[
\mathbf{E} =
\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}
\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}.
\]

Electric fields describe how space is structured around charges.

---

## 4.4 The Magnetic Field

Moving charges generate magnetic fields.

A current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field described by the Biot–Savart law.

The force on a moving charge is:

\[
\mathbf{F} =
q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}).
\]

This is the Lorentz force.

Magnetic fields do not change a particle’s speed directly; they curve its path.

In astrophysics, magnetic fields guide plasma motion and shape large-scale structures.

---

# Part II — Maxwell’s Equations

Electromagnetism is unified in Maxwell’s equations:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
\]

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
\]

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} =
\mu_0 \mathbf{J} +
\mu_0 \varepsilon_0
\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.
\]

These equations reveal:

- Electric fields arise from charge  
- Magnetic fields have no monopoles  
- Changing magnetic fields produce electric fields  
- Changing electric fields produce magnetic fields  

Together they imply electromagnetic waves.

---

## 4.5 Electromagnetic Waves

Combining Maxwell’s equations yields:

\[
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} =
\mu_0 \varepsilon_0
\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}.
\]

This is a wave equation with speed:

\[
c =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}.
\]

Thus light is an electromagnetic wave.

Its properties:

- Transverse  
- Travels at speed \(c\) in vacuum  
- Characterized by frequency \(\nu\) and wavelength \(\lambda\)

\[
c = \lambda \nu.
\]

# Part III — Electromagnetism in Astronomy

## 4.6 The Electromagnetic Spectrum

Astronomy observes across all wavelengths:

| Band | Wavelength Range | Example Sources |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| Radio | > 1 mm | Pulsars, molecular clouds |
| Microwave | mm–cm | CMB |
| Infrared | 700 nm–1 mm | Dust, cool stars |
| Optical | 400–700 nm | Stars |
| UV | 10–400 nm | Hot stars |
| X-ray | 0.01–10 nm | Accretion disks |
| Gamma-ray | < 0.01 nm | GRBs |

Different wavelengths probe different physical processes.

## 4.7 Radiation from Accelerating Charges

A fundamental principle:

> Accelerating charges emit radiation.

This leads to several key mechanisms.

---

### 4.7.1 Bremsstrahlung (Free–Free Radiation)

When electrons scatter off ions in a plasma, they accelerate and emit radiation.

Important in:

- H II regions  
- Hot interstellar medium  
- X-ray emission from galaxy clusters  

---

### 4.7.2 Synchrotron Radiation

Relativistic electrons spiraling in magnetic fields emit radiation.

Key properties:

- Non-thermal spectrum  
- Highly polarized  
- Broad wavelength coverage  

Found in:

- Supernova remnants  
- Pulsar wind nebulae  
- AGN jets  
- Galactic radio emission  

---

### 4.7.3 Cyclotron Radiation

Non-relativistic charged particles spiraling in magnetic fields.

Observed in:

- Magnetic white dwarfs  
- Accreting neutron stars  

---

## 4.8 Atomic Transitions and Spectral Lines

Electromagnetism governs atomic structure.

Electrons occupy quantized energy levels.

When an electron transitions:

\[
\Delta E = h\nu.
\]

This produces emission or absorption lines.

These lines allow us to measure:

- Chemical composition  
- Temperature  
- Density  
- Velocity (via Doppler shift)  

Spectroscopy is the backbone of astrophysics.

---

## 4.9 The Zeeman Effect

Magnetic fields split atomic energy levels.

Spectral lines split into components:

\[
\Delta \nu \propto B.
\]

This allows direct measurement of magnetic field strength in:

- Sunspots  
- Star-forming regions  
- Accretion disks  

---

## 4.10 Polarization

Electromagnetic waves can be polarized.

Polarization reveals:

- Magnetic field geometry  
- Scattering processes  
- Dust alignment  

Synchrotron radiation is strongly polarized, making polarization mapping a diagnostic tool for galactic magnetic fields.

---

## 4.11 Plasma Physics and Magnetohydrodynamics

Most visible matter in the universe exists as plasma.

Plasma behavior is governed by:

- Maxwell’s equations  
- Fluid dynamics  

In magnetohydrodynamics (MHD):

- Magnetic fields are “frozen” into conducting plasma  
- Field lines move with the fluid  

MHD explains:

- Solar flares  
- Stellar winds  
- Accretion disk turbulence  
- Jet collimation  

---

## 4.12 Magnetic Fields in Astronomy

Magnetic fields influence:

- Star formation (support against collapse)  
- Angular momentum transport  
- Accretion disk stability  
- Cosmic ray propagation  

They are difficult to measure directly but inferred from:

- Zeeman splitting  
- Polarization  
- Synchrotron emission  

---

## 4.13 Radiation Pressure

Electromagnetic radiation carries momentum.

Radiation pressure:

\[
P = \frac{F}{c}.
\]

This plays crucial roles in:

- Stellar structure (balances gravity in massive stars)  
- Dust dynamics  
- Radiation-driven winds  
- Eddington luminosity limit  

---

## 4.14 The Eddington Limit

When radiation pressure balances gravity:

\[
L_{\text{Edd}} =
\frac{4\pi G M c}{\kappa}.
\]

This sets a maximum stable luminosity for accreting objects.

It governs:

- Quasar brightness  
- Black hole growth rates  
- Massive star evolution  

---

## 4.15 From Fields to Observation

Electromagnetism determines:

- How stars shine  
- How plasmas glow  
- How jets radiate  
- How atoms absorb  
- How magnetic fields shape structure  

Without electromagnetism, the universe would be dark.

Gravity organizes matter.

Electromagnetism reveals it.

---

## 4.16 Summary

Electromagnetism provides:

- The framework for light  
- The mechanism of radiation  
- The origin of spectral lines  
- The structure of plasmas  
- The influence of magnetic fields  

Through Maxwell’s equations, accelerating charges, and atomic transitions, electromagnetism transforms motion and fields into observable light.

In astronomy, electromagnetism is not merely a force.

It is the messenger.
